## Krafto

Krafto is an ethical and local e‑commerce platform designed to reinvent how handmade products are sold online. It exists as an alternative to large marketplaces where real artisans are often drowned out by industrial products and aggressive competition.

The project focuses on giving verified artisans a fair, transparent, and human‑centric space to sell their creations. Instead of high fixed fees and opaque algorithms, Krafto aims for low commissions, no entry cost, and clear rules that exclude dropshipping and misleading “handmade” claims.

For artisans, Krafto’s goal is to offer visibility without financial risk, simple tools to manage their shop, and a supportive community that values their work. For buyers, it provides a trusted place to discover unique, local, and authentic pieces while knowing who they are buying from and under what conditions.

In the longer term, Krafto also aims to become a partner for local institutions (cities, tourism offices, chambers of crafts) that want to support their local artisans, by offering a shared, modern marketplace that highlights local know‑how instead of competing with it.
