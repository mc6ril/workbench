# Code Review

## Overview

Perform a thorough code review that verifies functionality, maintainability, and security before approving a change. Use the appropriate agent based on review focus.

## Agent

**Use**:

- **@Architecture Guardian**: For architecture compliance review (app/domain/shared boundaries, domain ownership, React Query + Zustand, SCSS variables, Supabase usage, A11y)
- **@QA & Test Coach**: For quality assurance review (test plans, e2e scenarios, A11y checks)

**Note**: For security-specific reviews, use the **Security Agent** instead.

## Steps

1. **Understand the change**
   - Read the PR description and related issues for context
   - Identify the scope of files and features impacted
   - Note any assumptions or questions to clarify with the author

2. **Architecture Compliance** (Use @Architecture Guardian)
   - Check modular domain architecture boundaries (`src/app`, `src/domains`, `src/shared`, plus domain ownership)
   - Verify layer separation (no Supabase in UI, no business logic in UI)
   - Check React Query + Zustand usage (React Query for server state, Zustand for UI state only)
   - Verify SCSS variables usage (no hardcoded values)
   - Check Supabase usage (only in infrastructure layer)
   - Verify accessibility compliance (shared/a11y/ utilities)

3. **Validate functionality**
   - Confirm the code delivers the intended behavior
   - Exercise edge cases or guard conditions mentally or by running locally
   - Check error handling paths and logging for clarity

4. **Assess quality** (Use @QA & Test Coach)
   - Ensure functions are focused, names are descriptive, and code is readable
   - Watch for duplication, dead code, or missing tests
   - Verify documentation and comments reflect the latest changes
   - Check test coverage and test plans
   - Verify A11y compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

5. **Review security and risk** (Use @Security Agent for deep security review)
   - Look for injection points, insecure defaults, or missing validation
   - Confirm secrets or credentials are not exposed
   - Evaluate performance or scalability impacts of the change

## Review Checklist

### Architecture Compliance

- [ ] Modular domain architecture boundaries verified
- [ ] Layer separation respected (no Supabase in UI, no business logic in UI)
- [ ] React Query + Zustand usage verified
- [ ] SCSS variables usage verified (no hardcoded values)
- [ ] Supabase usage verified (only in infrastructure layer)
- [ ] Accessibility compliance verified (shared/a11y/ utilities)

### Functionality

- [ ] Edge cases handled gracefully
- [ ] Error handling is appropriate and informative

### Code Quality

- [ ] Code structure is clear and maintainable
- [ ] No unnecessary duplication or dead code
- [ ] Tests/documentation updated as needed
- [ ] Test coverage adequate (~80% for domain/usecases)
- [ ] A11y compliance verified (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### Security & Safety

- [ ] No obvious security vulnerabilities introduced
- [ ] Inputs validated and outputs sanitized
- [ ] Sensitive data handled correctly
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials

## Additional Review Notes

- Architecture and design decisions considered
- Performance bottlenecks or regressions assessed
- Coding standards and best practices followed
- Resource management, error handling, and logging reviewed
- Suggested alternatives, additional test cases, or documentation updates captured

Provide constructive feedback with concrete examples and actionable guidance for the author.

## Output Format

Both agents use a standardized template:

```
# Code Review Report

**Description:** Brief 1-2 sentence summary of the review scope and findings.

**Status:** ✅ OK for merge | ⚠️ Refused | 🔴 Blocked

## Alerts

{ONLY_LIST_ALERTS_IF_ISSUES_FOUND}

### 🔴 High Risk
- `file:line` - **Issue:** {description} - **Recommendation:** {fix_or_action}

### ⚠️ Medium Risk
- `file:line` - **Issue:** {description} - **Recommendation:** {fix_or_action}

### ℹ️ Low Risk
- `file:line` - **Issue:** {description} - **Recommendation:** {fix_or_action}

{IF_NO_ISSUES:}
No issue detected. Code is ready for merge.
```

**Important:** Alerts are only listed if issues are found. If the code is clean, the report will clearly state that no issues were detected.
