# Run All Tests and Fix Failures

## Overview

Execute the full test suite and systematically fix any failures using the **Unit Test Coach** (for test fixes) or **Architecture-Aware Dev** (for implementation fixes), ensuring code quality and functionality.

## Agent

**Use**:

- @Unit Test Coach: For fixing test code issues
- @Architecture-Aware Dev: For fixing implementation issues that cause test failures

**Test Structure**:

- All tests in `__tests__/` directory at project root
- Jest framework (React Testing Library for reusable UI components only)
- Tests for domain/usecases/reusable UI components only (no page component tests)
- TypeScript only (.test.ts or .test.tsx)

## Steps

1. **Run test suite**
   - Execute all tests: `yarn test`
   - Capture output and identify failures
   - Check unit tests (domain/usecases/reusable UI components)
   - **Note**: No page component tests (only business logic and reusable UI components)

2. **Analyze failures**
   - Categorize by type: flaky, broken, new failures
   - Determine if issue is in test code or implementation
   - Prioritize fixes based on impact
   - Check if failures are related to recent changes

3. **Fix issues systematically**
   - **Test code issues** → Use @Unit Test Coach
   - **Implementation issues** → Use @Architecture-Aware Dev
   - Start with the most critical failures
   - Fix one issue at a time
   - Re-run tests after each fix: `yarn test --testPathPattern=<test-file>`

## Test Recovery Checklist

### Execution

- [ ] Full test suite executed (`yarn test`)
- [ ] Failures categorized and tracked
- [ ] Failures categorized by type (test code vs implementation)

### Fixes

- [ ] Test code issues fixed using Unit Test Coach
- [ ] Implementation issues fixed using Architecture-Aware Dev
- [ ] Root causes resolved
- [ ] Architecture compliance maintained (app/domain/shared boundaries, domain ownership, etc.)

### Verification

- [ ] Tests re-run with passing results
- [ ] No flaky tests introduced
- [ ] Test coverage maintained (~80% for domain/usecases)
- [ ] Follow-up improvements noted
