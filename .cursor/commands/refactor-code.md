# Refactor Code

## Overview

Refactor the selected code to improve its quality while maintaining the same functionality using the **Architecture-Aware Dev** agent. The refactored code must follow all architecture rules and include explanations of the improvements made.

## Agent

**Use**: @Architecture-Aware Dev

The Architecture-Aware Dev ensures refactoring respects:

- Domain + module architecture boundaries (`src/app`, `src/domains`, `src/modules`, `src/shared`, plus owner ownership)
- Layer separation (no Supabase in UI, no business logic in UI)
- React Query + Zustand usage (React Query for server state, Zustand for UI state only)
- SCSS variables from `styles/variables/*` only, no hardcoded values
- Accessibility utilities from `shared/a11y/`

## Steps

1. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Extract reusable functions or components
   - Eliminate code duplication
   - Improve variable and function naming
   - Simplify complex logic and reduce nesting
2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Identify and fix performance bottlenecks
   - Optimize algorithms and data structures
   - Reduce unnecessary computations
   - Improve memory usage
3. **Maintainability**
   - Make the code more readable and self-documenting
   - Add appropriate comments where needed
   - Follow SOLID principles and design patterns
   - Improve error handling and edge case coverage
