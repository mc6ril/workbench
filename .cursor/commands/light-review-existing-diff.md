# Light Review Existing Diffs

## Overview

Perform a quick quality pass on current diffs using the **Architecture Guardian** agent to surface risky areas, ensure polish, and flag follow-up actions for deeper review.

## Agent

**Use**: @Architecture Guardian

The Architecture Guardian performs a lightweight compliance check focusing on:

- Modular domain architecture boundaries
- Layer separation
- React Query + Zustand usage
- SCSS variables usage
- Supabase usage
- Accessibility compliance

## Steps

1. **Scan recent changes**
   - List open branches or pending commits requiring review
   - Skim side-by-side diffs focusing on new or modified files
   - Note files or modules with large or complex edits
2. **Assess architecture compliance**
   - Check domain + module architecture boundaries (`src/app`, `src/domains`, `src/modules`, `src/shared`, plus owner ownership)
   - Verify layer separation (no Supabase in UI, no business logic in UI)
   - Check React Query + Zustand usage (React Query for server state, Zustand for UI state only)
   - Verify SCSS variables usage (no hardcoded values)
   - Check Supabase usage (only in infrastructure layer)
   - Verify accessibility compliance (shared/a11y/ utilities)

3. **Assess quality signals**
   - Watch for TODOs, debug code, or commented blocks needing cleanup
   - Verify naming, formatting, and imports follow project standards
   - Check that tests or documentation were updated when behavior changed

4. **Flag next actions**
   - Mark sections that warrant full review or pair programming
   - Capture questions or uncertainties to raise with the author
   - Document any quick fixes you can apply immediately
   - List architecture violations with file:line references and minimal fixes
