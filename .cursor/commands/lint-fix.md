# Lint and Fix Code

## Overview

Analyze the current file for linting issues using the **Architecture-Aware Dev** agent and automatically fix them according to the project's coding standards, then apply the fixes directly to the code and explain what changes were made.

## Agent

**Use**: @Architecture-Aware Dev

The Architecture-Aware Dev ensures linting fixes respect:

- Import order (external → domain → usecases → infrastructure → presentation → shared → styles)
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Project-specific rules (modular domain architecture, shared vs domain placement, SCSS variables, etc.)

## Steps

1. **Identify linting issues**
   - Code formatting and style consistency
   - **Import order**: external → domain → usecases → infrastructure → presentation → shared → styles
   - Unused imports and variables
   - Missing semicolons or proper indentation
   - Best practice violations
   - Type safety issues (no `any` types)
   - Architecture rule violations (app/domain/shared boundaries, domain ownership, etc.)

2. **Apply fixes**
   - Fix formatting and style issues
   - Reorganize imports according to project standards
   - Remove unused imports and variables
   - Add missing semicolons or correct indentation
   - Apply best practice corrections
   - Fix type safety issues (add explicit return types, remove `any`)
   - Fix architecture rule violations
   - Run `yarn lint:fix` to apply automatic fixes
   - Explain what changes were made
