# Debug Issue

## Overview

Help debug the current issue in the code using the **Architecture-Aware Dev** agent by walking through the debugging process systematically and providing clear, actionable solutions.

## Agent

**Use**: @Architecture-Aware Dev

The Architecture-Aware Dev uses project-specific debugging tools:

- **Next.js DevTools**: Browser DevTools integration
- **React Query DevTools**: React Query state inspection
- **Zustand DevTools**: Zustand state inspection
- **Logger**: Structured logging

## Steps

1. **Problem Analysis**
   - Identify the specific problem or error
   - Understand the expected vs actual behavior
   - Trace the execution flow to find the root cause
2. **Debugging Strategy**
   - Add appropriate logging statements
   - **Next.js DevTools**: Use browser DevTools for debugging
   - **React Query DevTools**: Inspect React Query cache and queries
   - **Zustand DevTools**: Inspect Zustand state transitions
   - Trace data flow: route/domain UI → domain hooks → usecases → repositories → shared Supabase clients
   - Identify key variables and states to monitor
   - Recommend breakpoint locations
   - **Never log sensitive data** (passwords, tokens, personal info)
3. **Solution Approach**
   - Propose potential fixes with explanations
   - Consider multiple solution approaches
   - Evaluate trade-offs of different approaches
   - Provide step-by-step resolution plan
4. **Prevention**
   - Suggest ways to prevent similar issues
   - Recommend additional tests or checks
   - Identify code patterns that could be improved

## Debug Issue Checklist

### Problem Analysis

- [ ] Identified the specific problem or error
- [ ] Understood expected vs actual behavior
- [ ] Traced execution flow to find root cause
- [ ] Traced data flow if applicable (route/domain UI → domain hooks → usecases → repositories → shared Supabase clients)

### Debugging Tools

- [ ] Added appropriate logging statements
- [ ] Used Next.js DevTools for debugging
- [ ] Used React Query DevTools for cache inspection
- [ ] Used Zustand DevTools for state inspection
- [ ] Verified no sensitive data in logs

### Solution

- [ ] Proposed potential fixes with explanations
- [ ] Evaluated trade-offs of different approaches
- [ ] Provided step-by-step resolution plan
- [ ] Ensured fixes respect architecture rules (app/domain/shared boundaries, domain ownership, etc.)

### Prevention

- [ ] Suggested ways to prevent similar issues
- [ ] Recommended additional tests or checks
- [ ] Identified code patterns that could be improved
