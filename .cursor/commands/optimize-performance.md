# Optimize Performance

## Overview

Analyze the current code for performance bottlenecks using the **Architecture-Aware Dev** agent and provide optimization recommendations, focusing on measurable improvements while maintaining code quality, readability, and architecture compliance.

## Agent

**Use**: @Architecture-Aware Dev

The Architecture-Aware Dev ensures optimizations respect architecture rules and include Next.js-specific optimizations.

## Steps

1. **Performance Analysis**
   - Identify slow algorithms and inefficient data structures
   - Find memory leaks and excessive allocations
   - Detect unnecessary computations and redundant operations
   - Analyze database queries and API calls
2. **Next.js Specific Optimizations**
   - Component memoization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback)
   - React Query optimization (queryKeys, staleTime, select, enabled)
   - Zustand selector optimization (specific selectors, not entire state)
   - Next.js Image component for optimized image loading
   - Code splitting and dynamic imports
   - Prevent unnecessary re-renders

3. **Optimization Strategies**
   - Suggest algorithm improvements and better data structures
   - Recommend caching strategies where appropriate
   - Propose lazy loading and pagination solutions
   - Identify opportunities for parallel processing

4. **Implementation**
   - Provide optimized code with explanations
   - Include performance impact estimates
   - Suggest profiling and monitoring approaches
   - Consider trade-offs between performance and maintainability
