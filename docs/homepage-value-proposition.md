## Proposed value proposition (hero title + subtitle)

-   **Final hero title (short, buyer-centric):**

    -   "Make supplier catalogs clear, centralized, and easy to act on."

-   **Final hero subtitle (context and outcome oriented):**
    -   "Krafto helps purchasing teams centralize supplier offers, compare options faster, and share an always up-to-date catalog with their internal stakeholders."

## Core promises for buyers (homepage bullets)

1. **Centralize supplier catalogs in one place**
    - Bring products, prices, and conditions from multiple suppliers into a single, structured catalog instead of scattered files and emails.
2. **Compare offers and decide faster**
    - Quickly see differences between suppliers and products so purchasing decisions take minutes instead of days.
3. **Keep internal stakeholders aligned and informed**
    - Share a clear, up-to-date catalog that makes it easy for teams to choose the right products while respecting purchasing constraints.

## Copy variants and notes

-   **Alternative hero title options:**
    -   "Turn scattered supplier data into a clear, actionable catalog."
    -   "Give purchasing teams a clear view of all supplier options in one place."
-   **Positioning notes:**
    -   Emphasize "centralization" and "clarity" as primary themes.
    -   Reinforce "speed of decision" and "internal alignment" as key outcomes.
    -   Keep sentences short and scannable to work well in the homepage hero layout.

## Mapping to homepage UI and implementation handoff

-   **Hero section:**
    -   Use the final hero title as the main H1 heading in the homepage hero.
    -   Use the final hero subtitle as supporting text directly under the H1.
-   **Promises section:**
    -   Display the three core promises as a bulleted list (or equivalent UI component) near the hero, keeping each promise as one short, scannable sentence.
-   **Implementation ticket link:**
    -   Follow-up implementation work is tracked in `jira/2.md` (krafto-2 – Implement homepage value proposition and buyer promises).
