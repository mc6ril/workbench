## Primary buyer persona

-   Role: Procurement or purchasing manager in a small to mid-sized company.
-   Context: Needs to source products and services from multiple suppliers, often with limited time and visibility.
-   Responsibilities: Building and maintaining supplier catalogs, comparing offers, ensuring budget alignment, and supporting internal stakeholders with the right options.

## Key problems Krafto solves for buyers

-   Fragmented supplier information across spreadsheets, emails, and separate tools makes it hard to get a clear view of options.
-   Time-consuming manual comparison of prices, conditions, and product details slows down decision making.
-   Difficulty maintaining a consistent and up-to-date catalog for internal stakeholders (outdated products, missing information, inconsistent naming).

## Desired outcomes for buyers using Krafto

-   Centralized, always up-to-date catalog of supplier products that is easy to search and browse.
-   Faster decision making thanks to clear comparisons and structured information (prices, availability, conditions).
-   Increased confidence that buyers and internal stakeholders are choosing the right products from the right suppliers, aligned with company constraints and policies.
