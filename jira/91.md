### Git Branch

`feat/workbench-91-app-router-error-pages`

---

### Description

Implement standard Next.js App Router error handling for unknown routes and runtime errors. This includes a `not-found` page and an `error` boundary page with recovery actions.

### User Story

As a user, I want clear and accessible error pages so that I can recover or navigate back when something goes wrong.

---

### Acceptance Criteria

- A global `not-found` page exists and is used for unknown routes.
- A global `error` boundary page exists and is used for route errors.
- Error pages:
  - Are fully i18n-driven (no hardcoded user-facing strings).
  - Are accessible (semantic structure, `role="alert"` / appropriate ARIA, keyboard accessible actions).
  - Provide at least one recovery action (e.g., “Go back” / “Reload” / “Go to project”).
- No business logic is introduced; error pages are purely presentation.

---

### Technical Considerations

- **Presentation**
  - Implement `src/app/not-found.tsx` and `src/app/error.tsx` (or route-group equivalents if preferred).
  - Use reusable UI components from `src/presentation/components/ui/` and respect accessibility utilities from `src/shared/a11y/`.
- **i18n**
  - Add translation keys to `src/shared/i18n/messages/fr.json` (e.g., `pages.errors.notFound.*`, `pages.errors.unexpected.*`).

---

### Definition of Done

- Not-found and error pages render with correct routing behavior.
- Accessible and i18n-compliant UI.
