### Git Branch

`feat/workbench-85-backlog-page-ticket-list`

---

### Description

The backlog route exists (`src/app/(auth)/[projectId]/backlog/page.tsx`) but is currently a placeholder. Build the actual backlog experience: a paginated list of tickets with filters, sorting, and bulk actions.

### User Story

As a project member, I want to browse and manage the project backlog so that I can prioritize and act on tickets efficiently.

---

### Acceptance Criteria

- `/[projectId]/backlog` renders:
  - Ticket list with at least: key/title/status/assignee/priority (as available in current domain model).
  - Filtering (e.g., status, assignee, priority) and free-text search (if supported by existing hooks/usecases).
  - Sorting (at least one sortable column).
  - Bulk actions entry point (select multiple tickets and trigger an action; the action can be a no-op placeholder only if explicitly labeled as disabled).
- Data fetching uses a React Query hook that calls a usecase (no Supabase calls in UI).
- All user-facing strings use i18n keys.
- Accessible interactions:
  - Table/list has proper semantics, keyboard navigation, and screen-reader-friendly labels.
  - Selection state is announced properly (aria attributes).
- No inline styles; SCSS modules and variables are used.

---

### Technical Considerations (Clean Architecture)

- **Presentation**
  - Replace placeholder content in `src/app/(auth)/[projectId]/backlog/page.tsx`.
  - Create page-specific components under `src/presentation/components/backlog.../` (folder per component).
  - Add/extend hook(s) in `src/presentation/hooks/` (e.g., `useTickets` / `useBacklogTickets`) that call usecases.
- **Usecases**
  - Add or extend list/search/sort orchestration in `src/core/usecases/` (validate inputs with Zod if new input types are introduced).
- **Ports + Infrastructure**
  - Ensure ticket repository supports required query options (filters/sort/pagination) via contracts in `src/core/ports/`.
  - Supabase implementation remains in `src/infrastructure/supabase/`.
- **Tests**
  - Add/adjust unit tests for new/updated usecases in `__tests__/core/usecases/`.

---

### Definition of Done

- Backlog page shows real data (or a clearly-defined empty state) with filter/sort UI.
- All strings are i18n-driven and accessible.
- New/updated usecases have unit tests; no page tests are added.
