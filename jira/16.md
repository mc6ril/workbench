# Create Test Directory Structure

- Type: Task
- Priority: Medium
- Story Points: 1
- Labels: testing, structure
- Git Branch: `feat/workbench-16-test-directory-structure`

## Description

Create the test directory structure at the project root mirroring `src/`, following the project's testing conventions.

## User Story

As a developer, I want a clear test directory structure so that tests are easy to locate and maintain.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `__tests__/` directory created at project root
- [ ] Subdirectories created to mirror `src/core/`, `src/infrastructure/`, and `src/presentation/components/ui/` as needed
- [ ] Empty directories include `.gitkeep` files

## Technical Considerations

- Domain: tests for domain entities and business rules under `__tests__/core/domain/`
- Usecases: tests for usecases under `__tests__/core/usecases/`
- Presentation: tests for reusable UI components under `__tests__/presentation/components/ui/`
- Infrastructure: generally tested via usecases, not directly

## Definition of Done

- [ ] `__tests__/` directory structure created and committed
- [ ] Sample test files placed in appropriate locations
- [ ] Testing documentation updated to reference new structure

## Related Components

- Files: `__tests__/**`
- Dependencies: Jest, React Testing Library
