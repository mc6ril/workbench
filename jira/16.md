# Authentication Screens (Signup & Signin)

- Type: Task
- Priority: High
- Story Points: 3
- Labels: auth, ui, supabase, verification
- Git Branch: `feat/workbench-16-authentication-screens`

## Description

Implement simple signup and signin screens using Supabase Auth to allow users to authenticate. These screens are minimal implementations to verify the authentication system works correctly with the RLS policies.

## User Story

As a user, I want to sign up and sign in to Workbench so that I can access my projects and work items.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Signup Screen**
  - [ ] Simple form with email and password fields (use react-hook-form)
  - [ ] Validation for email format and password requirements
  - [ ] Integration with Supabase Auth `signUp()` method
  - [ ] Error handling and display for signup failures
  - [ ] Success redirect to signin or project overview page

- [ ] **Signin Screen**
  - [ ] Simple form with email and password fields (use react-hook-form)
  - [ ] Integration with Supabase Auth `signInWithPassword()` method
  - [ ] Error handling and display for signin failures (invalid credentials, etc.)
  - [ ] Success redirect to project overview page
  - [ ] Remember session (handled by Supabase client configuration)

- [ ] **Navigation**
  - [ ] Routes created: `/signup` and `/signin`
  - [ ] Links between signup and signin pages
  - [ ] Minimal design (basic form styling only)

## Technical Considerations

- **Domain**: None (authentication is handled by Supabase Auth)
- **Usecases**: Optional auth usecases (`signUp`, `signIn`) in `core/usecases/auth/` if following Clean Architecture pattern strictly
- **Infrastructure**: Supabase Auth client methods (`supabaseClient.auth.signUp()`, `supabaseClient.auth.signInWithPassword()`)
- **Presentation**:
  - Signup page: `app/signup/page.tsx`
  - Signin page: `app/signin/page.tsx`
  - Optional auth hooks: `presentation/hooks/useSignUp.ts`, `presentation/hooks/useSignIn.ts`
- **Dependencies**: Supabase Auth (already configured in client)

**Note**: For this simple verification implementation, Supabase Auth can be called directly from pages. For production, consider creating auth usecases and hooks following Clean Architecture.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Signup page functional with Supabase Auth integration
- [ ] Signin page functional with Supabase Auth integration
- [ ] Error handling implemented for auth failures
- [ ] Success redirects work correctly
- [ ] Routes accessible at `/signup` and `/signin`
- [ ] No hardcoded values (use SCSS variables when styling)
- [ ] Basic accessibility (form labels, error messages)
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds
- [ ] No linting errors
