# UX/UI Design System Update

- Type: Feature
- Priority: High
- Story Points: 13
- Labels: design-system, ux, ui, refactoring, components, animations
- Git Branch: `feat/workbench-23-ux-ui-design-system`

## Description

Implement a comprehensive design system and refactor connection, landing, and workspace screens with modern design and animations. Establish reusable components in `presentation/components/ui/` following DRY principles with clear layer separation, consistent design, and unit tests.

## User Story

As a user, I want a modern, consistent, and polished user interface across all screens so that I have a delightful and intuitive experience when using the application.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Design System Foundation**
  - [ ] Create design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, shadows, animations) in `styles/variables/`
  - [ ] Document design system principles and usage guidelines
  - [ ] Ensure all design tokens are used consistently (no hardcoded values)

- [ ] **Reusable UI Components**
  - [ ] Create/refactor reusable components in `presentation/components/ui/`:
    - [ ] `Title` / `Heading` components (h1, h2, h3 variants)
    - [ ] `Text` / `Paragraph` components with variants
    - [ ] `Input` component with states (default, error, disabled)
    - [ ] `Form` component with validation display
    - [ ] `Button` component with variants (primary, secondary, outline, ghost)
  - [ ] All components follow Clean Architecture (no business logic)
  - [ ] All components use SCSS variables from `styles/variables/`
  - [ ] All components have proper accessibility attributes (ARIA, semantic HTML)
  - [ ] All reusable components have unit tests in `__tests__/presentation/components/ui/`

- [ ] **Connection Screen Refactor**
  - [ ] Refactor authentication screens (sign-in, sign-up, password reset) using new design system
  - [ ] Use reusable components from `presentation/components/ui/`
  - [ ] Add modern animations (transitions, micro-interactions)
  - [ ] Ensure responsive design and accessibility compliance
  - [ ] Remove hardcoded styles, use SCSS variables

- [ ] **Landing Page Refactor**
  - [ ] Refactor public landing page using new design system
  - [ ] Use reusable components from `presentation/components/ui/`
  - [ ] Add modern animations and transitions
  - [ ] Ensure responsive design and accessibility compliance
  - [ ] Remove hardcoded styles, use SCSS variables

- [ ] **Workspace Screen Refactor**
  - [ ] Refactor workspace page using new design system
  - [ ] Use reusable components from `presentation/components/ui/`
  - [ ] Add modern animations and transitions
  - [ ] Ensure responsive design and accessibility compliance
  - [ ] Remove hardcoded styles, use SCSS variables

- [ ] **Code Quality**
  - [ ] All components follow project conventions (arrow functions, type Props, export default)
  - [ ] All SCSS uses variables from `styles/variables/` (no hardcoded values)
  - [ ] All components are properly memoized (React.memo, useCallback, useMemo where needed)
  - [ ] No business logic in presentation layer components
  - [ ] Clear separation between reusable (`ui/`) and page-specific components

## Technical Considerations

- **Presentation Layer** (`presentation/components/ui/`):
  - Create/refactor reusable UI components (Title, Text, Input, Form, Button)
  - All components must be pure UI (no business logic, no hooks except for UI state)
  - Components receive data via props
  - Use SCSS modules for component-specific styles
  - Use global SCSS variables from `styles/variables/`

- **Presentation Layer** (`presentation/components/`):
  - Refactor page-specific components (connection, landing, workspace)
  - Use reusable components from `ui/` directory
  - Maintain clear separation: page-specific components in their own folders

- **Styles** (`styles/`):
  - Create/update design tokens in `styles/variables/`:
    - Colors (primary, secondary, success, error, neutral)
    - Typography (font families, sizes, weights, line heights)
    - Spacing (consistent spacing scale)
    - Shadows (elevation system)
    - Animations (transition durations, easing functions)
  - Update global styles in `styles/global.scss` if needed
  - Component-specific styles in component folders

- **Tests** (`__tests__/presentation/components/ui/`):
  - Write unit tests for all reusable UI components
  - Test component rendering, props, accessibility attributes
  - Test user interactions (clicks, form submissions)
  - Use React Testing Library

- **Animations**:
  - Use CSS transitions and animations (prefer CSS over JavaScript)
  - Use SCSS variables for animation durations and easing
  - Ensure animations are performant (use transform, opacity)
  - Respect user preferences (prefers-reduced-motion)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Design system tokens created in `styles/variables/`
- [ ] All reusable UI components created/refactored in `presentation/components/ui/`
- [ ] Connection screens refactored with new design system
- [ ] Landing page refactored with new design system
- [ ] Workspace screen refactored with new design system
- [ ] All reusable components have unit tests
- [ ] All components use SCSS variables (no hardcoded values)
- [ ] All components have proper accessibility attributes
- [ ] Modern animations implemented across all screens
- [ ] Responsive design verified on multiple screen sizes
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No ESLint errors
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code review completed

## Related Components

- `src/presentation/components/ui/` - Reusable UI components directory
- `src/presentation/components/` - Page-specific components
- `src/app/(auth)/` - Authentication screens to refactor
- `src/app/(public)/` - Landing page to refactor
- `src/app/(auth)/workspace/` - Workspace page to refactor
- `src/styles/variables/` - Design system tokens
- `src/styles/global.scss` - Global styles
- `__tests__/presentation/components/ui/` - Unit tests for reusable components

## Dependencies

- None (standalone feature)

## Notes

- Focus on establishing a solid design system foundation before refactoring screens
- Ensure all animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility
- Reusable components should be flexible and composable
- Maintain backward compatibility during refactoring (incremental approach)
- Document component usage and design system guidelines
- Consider creating a Storybook or component showcase (optional, future enhancement)
