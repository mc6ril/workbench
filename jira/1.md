## Type

Story

## Priority

## Story Points

3

## Area

-   Buyer
-   Home / Landing

## Description

Krafto must clearly communicate its core value for buyers on the homepage by defining a concise value proposition and 2–3 key promises that set expectations about what buyers can achieve with the product.

## User Story

As a buyer discovering Krafto for the first time, I want to immediately understand what Krafto does and what benefits it offers me so that I can quickly decide whether it is relevant to my needs.

## Outcome

A concise value proposition and 2–3 core promises are defined for the homepage.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A single, clear value proposition sentence is defined, written in buyer-centric language, and focused on the main problem Krafto solves for buyers.
2. 2–3 core promises are defined that:
    - Explicitly describe what buyers can expect from Krafto (e.g., outcomes, capabilities, or guarantees).
    - Are consistent with the overall product positioning and target persona.
    - Are short, scannable, and suitable for homepage display.
3. The value proposition and promises are validated with:
    - Alignment with existing product vision, roadmap, and positioning.
    - Internal review with at least one product stakeholder.
4. The final copy (value proposition + promises) is documented in a format ready for direct integration into the homepage (e.g., main hero title, subtitle, and supporting bullet points).
5. Any open questions, trade-offs, or copy variants (if multiple options remain) are explicitly documented for future UX/content iterations.

## Technical Considerations

-   No code changes are strictly required for this ticket; focus is on messaging and content.
-   Document final copy and structure so it can be plugged into the homepage implementation (hero section, promise bullets, etc.).
-   Ensure wording is consistent with planned domain concepts and naming in the product (e.g., how we name buyers, suppliers, catalogs, etc.).

## Definition of Done

-   Value proposition sentence is written, reviewed, and approved by product owner (or equivalent).
-   2–3 core promises are written, reviewed, and approved.
-   Final copy is documented in the repo (e.g., in `docs/` or design documentation) and linked from this ticket.
-   Ambiguities and pending decisions (if any) are clearly listed with proposed next steps.
-   Ticket is ready to be used as input for a follow-up implementation ticket to update the homepage content.
