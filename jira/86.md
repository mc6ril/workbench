### Git Branch

`feat/workbench-86-board-page-kanban`

---

### Description

The board route exists (`src/app/(auth)/[projectId]/board/page.tsx`) but is currently a placeholder. Build the Kanban board UI with accessible drag-and-drop and column configuration support.

### User Story

As a project member, I want to visualize tickets on a board and move them between columns so that I can manage workflow quickly.

---

### Acceptance Criteria

- `/[projectId]/board` renders:
  - Board columns with titles and ticket cards.
  - Drag-and-drop for ticket cards between columns, with keyboard-accessible interaction (not mouse-only).
  - Updating a ticket’s status/column triggers a mutation via a React Query hook calling a usecase.
  - Loading, empty, and error states are shown and accessible.
- Column configuration is sourced from the project settings (statuses/columns) when available; otherwise, a safe fallback is used.
- All user-facing strings use i18n keys (no hardcoded strings).
- No business logic in UI; everything goes through hooks/usecases/repositories.

---

### Technical Considerations (Clean Architecture)

- **Presentation**
  - Replace placeholder content in `src/app/(auth)/[projectId]/board/page.tsx`.
  - Add page-specific components under `src/presentation/components/board.../`.
  - Add React Query hooks (e.g., `useBoardTickets`, `useUpdateTicketStatus`) calling usecases.
- **Usecases**
  - Add usecases for listing board tickets and updating ticket status/column.
  - Validate inputs in usecases using Zod when applicable.
- **Ports + Infrastructure**
  - Ensure repository contracts support the required operations (list by board/status, update status).
  - Supabase implementation handles mappings and error conversion.
- **Accessibility**
  - Ensure drag-and-drop supports keyboard users and announces changes via live regions where needed.

---

### Definition of Done

- Board page displays columns and tickets and supports moving tickets between columns.
- Mutations update the data model via usecases (no direct Supabase in UI).
- i18n and accessibility requirements are met.
- New/updated usecases have unit tests in `__tests__/core/usecases/`.
