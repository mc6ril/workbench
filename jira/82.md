## Jira Ticket

**Title:** Implement Zustand UI stores for filters, sorting, modals, board view, selection, and theme

**Type:** Story  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Labels:** `ui-state`, `zustand`, `presentation`, `clean-architecture`

**Git Branch:** `feat/workbench-82-zustand-ui-stores`

### Description

Introduce a set of dedicated Zustand stores to manage UI-only state (filters, sorting preferences, modal visibility, board view settings, bulk selection, and theme preferences) without leaking any business logic into the presentation layer.

### User Story

As a user, I want consistent UI state (filters, sorting, selection, modals, theme) so that navigation between views feels predictable and efficient.

### Acceptance Criteria

- **Stores created**: The following files exist under `src/presentation/stores/` and export a Zustand store hook matching the file name:
  - `useFilterStore.ts` (backlog filters: search, status, epic)
  - `useSortStore.ts` (ticket sorting preferences)
  - `useModalStore.ts` (global modal state management)
  - `useBoardStore.ts` (board view UI state: selected columns, board filters)
  - `useSelectionStore.ts` (bulk selection state for backlog)
  - `useThemeStore.ts` (theme preferences; if feature is enabled/implemented)
- **UI state only**: No store calls Supabase, no store calls usecases, and no business rules exist in stores (presentation-only state).
- **Performance-friendly usage**: Stores expose stable setters and are designed to be consumed via selectors (avoid unnecessary rerenders).
- **Type safety**: All state and actions are explicitly typed; no `any`.
- **Naming conventions**: Hooks are named `useXxxStore` and files follow `useXxxStore.ts`.

### Technical Considerations (Clean Architecture)

- **Presentation**:
  - Create stores in `src/presentation/stores/` only.
  - Stores must remain pure UI state containers (filters/modals/selection/view preferences).
- **Out of scope**:
  - No domain/usecase/infrastructure changes required.
  - No persistence layer (localStorage) unless explicitly requested by a follow-up ticket.

### Definition of Done

- Stores are implemented in the correct folder with correct naming.
- No forbidden imports (Supabase/usecases) in stores.
- TypeScript passes (strict, no `any`).
- Minimal documentation added only where non-obvious.
