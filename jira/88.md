### Git Branch

`feat/workbench-88-epic-detail-page`

---

### Description

Add a dedicated epic detail route to view epic metadata and the tickets linked to the epic, enabling navigation from the epics list.

### User Story

As a project member, I want to open an epic detail page so that I can understand scope and see all linked tickets.

---

### Acceptance Criteria

- A new route exists at `/(auth)/[projectId]/epics/[id]`.
- The page renders:
  - Epic title and key fields (as available).
  - A list of linked tickets with navigation to ticket detail.
- Data fetching uses React Query hooks calling usecases (no direct Supabase calls).
- All user-facing strings use i18n keys.
- Accessible layout and list semantics, with proper loading/error/empty states.

---

### Technical Considerations (Clean Architecture)

- **Presentation**
  - Create `src/app/(auth)/[projectId]/epics/[id]/page.tsx`.
  - Create page-specific components under `src/presentation/components/epicDetail.../`.
  - Add hooks (e.g., `useEpicDetail`, `useEpicTickets`) in `src/presentation/hooks/`.
- **Usecases**
  - Add `getEpicDetail` and `listTicketsByEpic` (or equivalent) usecases if missing.
  - Validate route params in usecases when appropriate.
- **Ports + Infrastructure**
  - Ensure repositories expose required methods: get epic by id, list tickets by epic id.
  - Keep Supabase mapping inside `src/infrastructure/supabase/`.
- **Tests**
  - Unit tests for new/updated usecases in `__tests__/core/usecases/`.

---

### Definition of Done

- Epic detail route works end-to-end with proper states and navigation links.
- Architecture direction is respected; i18n and accessibility requirements are met.
- Usecases have unit tests; no page tests are introduced.
