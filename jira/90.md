## Jira Ticket

### Summary

Finalize **Settings**: wire `/[projectId]/settings` tabs to real data and mutations (project, statuses/columns, priorities, export/import).

### Git Branch

`feat/workbench-90-settings-data-wiring`

---

### Description

The settings page exists and already has a tabbed layout, but it uses no-op callbacks and empty data arrays. Implement the real data loading and persistence flows for each tab.

Note: The planning table mentions separate routes (`/settings/project`, `/settings/statuses`, etc.), but the current implementation uses tabs inside `/settings`. This ticket should either (a) keep the tabbed approach and implement the full functionality, or (b) refactor to nested routes if that is preferred—without mixing concerns across layers.

### User Story

As a project admin, I want to configure my project settings so that the board and workflow reflect my team’s needs.

---

### Acceptance Criteria

- `/[projectId]/settings` loads initial data for:
  - Project settings (name, description).
  - Statuses/columns settings (board columns configuration).
  - Priorities settings.
  - Export/import settings.
- Saving changes triggers React Query mutations that call usecases (no direct Supabase calls in components/pages).
- Settings UI shows clear loading, success, and error states (all i18n-driven and accessible).
- No hardcoded user-facing strings are introduced.
- Any input validation occurs in usecases (Zod), and invalid input results in meaningful errors displayed in the UI.

---

### Technical Considerations (Clean Architecture)

- **Presentation**
  - Replace no-op handlers in `src/app/(auth)/[projectId]/settings/page.tsx` with real hooks.
  - Add/extend hooks in `src/presentation/hooks/` (e.g., `useProjectSettings`, `useStatusesColumns`, `usePriorities`, `useExportImport`).
- **Usecases**
  - Add/extend usecases to load/update project, statuses, priorities, and export/import flows.
  - Validate inputs with Zod schemas in `src/core/domain/**/schemas`.
- **Ports + Infrastructure**
  - Define/extend repository contracts in `src/core/ports/` and implement in `src/infrastructure/supabase/`.
  - Ensure consistent error mapping from Supabase to repository/domain errors.
- **Tests**
  - Unit tests for any new/changed usecases in `__tests__/core/usecases/`.

---

### Definition of Done

- Settings tabs display real data and persist updates using usecases and repositories.
- i18n and accessibility requirements are met.
- Usecases have unit tests; no page tests are added.
