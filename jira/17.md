# Create Mocks Directory Structure

- Type: Task
- Priority: Medium
- Story Points: 1
- Labels: testing, mocks, structure
- Git Branch: `feat/workbench-17-mocks-directory-structure`

## Description

Create a shared mocks directory at project root to centralize mocks for external dependencies and repositories.

## User Story

As a developer, I want a dedicated mocks directory so that I can reuse mock implementations across tests without duplication.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `__mocks__/` directory created at project root
- [ ] Initial mock files or placeholders created (e.g., Supabase, React Query)
- [ ] Empty subdirectories include `.gitkeep` files

## Technical Considerations

- Domain: none
- Usecases: usecases should use mocked repositories in tests
- Infrastructure: repository implementations may use mocks for Supabase client
- Presentation: hooks and components may rely on mocks for data fetching

## Definition of Done

- [ ] `__mocks__/` directory structure created and committed
- [ ] At least one mock file created (e.g., Supabase client mock)
- [ ] Testing documentation updated to explain mocks usage

## Related Components

- Files: `__mocks__/**`
- Dependencies: Jest mocking utilities, Supabase client
