### Git Branch

`feat/workbench-87-epics-list-page`

---

### Description

The epics list route exists (`src/app/(auth)/[projectId]/epics/page.tsx`) but is currently a placeholder. Build an epic list experience and a clear entry point to create an epic.

### User Story

As a project member, I want to browse epics and create a new epic so that I can plan work at a higher level.

---

### Acceptance Criteria

- `/[projectId]/epics` renders:
  - A list of epics with at least: name/title, status (if any), and a link to epic detail.
  - A “Create epic” action entry point (button) that triggers the create flow (modal or navigation).
- Data is fetched via a React Query hook calling a usecase (no direct Supabase calls in the page/components).
- All user-visible strings use i18n keys.
- Accessible UI:
  - List has semantic structure.
  - Create action has proper aria-label and keyboard support.

---

### Technical Considerations (Clean Architecture)

- **Presentation**
  - Replace placeholder content in `src/app/(auth)/[projectId]/epics/page.tsx`.
  - Create page-specific components under `src/presentation/components/epics.../`.
  - Add `useEpics()` hook (or equivalent) in `src/presentation/hooks/` calling usecases.
- **Usecases**
  - Add/extend `listEpics` usecase if not already present.
  - If create input is introduced, validate with Zod in the usecase.
- **Ports + Infrastructure**
  - Ensure `EpicRepository` supports list/create operations as required.
- **Tests**
  - Add unit tests for new/updated usecases in `__tests__/core/usecases/`.

---

### Definition of Done

- Epics page lists epics (or shows a proper empty state) and provides a create entry point.
- No hardcoded strings; i18n and accessibility requirements are met.
- New/updated usecases are covered by unit tests.
