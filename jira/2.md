## Title

Implement homepage value proposition and buyer promises (B-HOME-01)

## Type

Story

## Priority

High

## Story Points

3

## Area

-   Buyer
-   Home / Landing

## Description

Using the finalized messaging from krafto-1 (B-HOME-01), implement the homepage hero section and buyer promises so that first-time buyers immediately understand Krafto’s value and key benefits.

## User Story

As a buyer landing on the Krafto homepage, I want to immediately see a clear value proposition and 2–3 key promises so that I understand how Krafto helps me and why I should explore further.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Homepage hero displays the selected value proposition (title and subtitle) from `docs/homepage-value-proposition.md` using the i18n system (no hardcoded strings).
2. Homepage includes 2–3 buyer promises as short, scannable bullets consistent with the content defined in `docs/homepage-value-proposition.md`.
3. All new texts are implemented via i18n keys in `src/shared/i18n/messages/*.json` following naming conventions and are type-safe.
4. Layout remains responsive and accessible (proper heading levels, list semantics, and keyboard navigation) and passes basic a11y checks.

## Technical Considerations

-   Follow Clean Architecture conventions: presentation layer only, no business logic in the page component.
-   Use existing styling system (SCSS variables in `styles/variables/*`) for spacing, colors, and typography.
-   Ensure all user-facing copy is sourced from i18n and matches the final wording in `docs/homepage-value-proposition.md`.
-   Coordinate with design if additional layout adjustments are needed for hero and promises sections.

## Definition of Done

-   Homepage hero and promises sections use the finalized copy from `docs/homepage-value-proposition.md`.
-   All strings are managed via i18n with appropriate keys and namespaces.
-   Page passes TypeScript, linting, and basic accessibility checks (landmarks, headings, list semantics, and focus order).
-   Manual verification performed on desktop and mobile breakpoints.
-   Ticket is linked back to krafto-1 planning and messaging docs.
