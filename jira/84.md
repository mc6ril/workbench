## Jira Ticket

### Summary

Implement the **Project Home Dashboard** widgets on `/[projectId]` (quick add, my work, recent activity, shortcuts), using existing layout as a base.

### Git Branch

`feat/workbench-84-project-home-dashboard-widgets`

---

### Description

The project root page (`/(auth)/[projectId]`) already exists but only renders a header + shortcuts widget. Expand it into the planned dashboard with additional widgets and proper empty/loading/error states.

### User Story

As a project member, I want a dashboard overview of my work and recent activity so that I can quickly navigate and take action.

---

### Acceptance Criteria

- The `/[projectId]` page renders a dashboard layout containing:
  - A "Quick add" widget (entry point to create a ticket/epic; actual create flow can link to existing routes if full form is not ready).
  - A "My work" widget (shows assigned/open items; placeholder allowed if data model is not ready, but must be i18n-driven and accessible).
  - A "Recent activity" widget (shows recent events; placeholder allowed if event model is not ready, but must be i18n-driven and accessible).
  - The existing shortcuts widget remains and is integrated consistently.
- All user-visible strings use `useTranslation()` keys (no hardcoded strings in components/pages).
- Loading and error states are accessible (ARIA roles, no silent failures).
- No business logic in UI: data is retrieved via React Query hooks calling usecases (UI → hook → usecase → repository → Supabase).

---

### Technical Considerations (Clean Architecture)

- **Presentation**
  - Update `src/app/(auth)/[projectId]/page.tsx` to compose page-specific components (in `src/presentation/components/...` folders).
  - Create/extend React Query hooks in `src/presentation/hooks/` for the widgets (if backed by data).
- **Usecases**
  - Add minimal orchestration usecases in `src/core/usecases/` (only if data is required).
- **Ports + Infrastructure**
  - If new data endpoints are needed, define repository contracts in `src/core/ports/` and implement in `src/infrastructure/supabase/`.
- **i18n**
  - Add translation keys to `src/shared/i18n/messages/fr.json` in an appropriate namespace (e.g., `pages.projectHome.*`).

---

### Definition of Done

- Dashboard widgets are visible and integrated on `/[projectId]`.
- No hardcoded user-facing strings in the new/updated components.
- New usecases/domain logic (if any) have unit tests in `__tests__/core/usecases/`.
- Code respects Clean Architecture import direction.
