## Description

Implement the Ticket detail page-specific components (TicketOverview, TicketEditForm, SubtasksList, SubtaskItem, CreateSubtaskForm, EpicLinkSelector) to provide a complete ticket management experience aligned with section 4.2 of the planning document.

## User Story

As a user, I want to view and edit a ticket, manage its subtasks, and link it to an epic so that I can keep work items organized and up to date.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Component Structure**
   - [ ] `TicketOverview` component created under `src/presentation/components/ticketOverview/TicketOverview.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] `TicketEditForm` component created under `src/presentation/components/ticketEditForm/TicketEditForm.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] `SubtasksList` component created under `src/presentation/components/subtasksList/SubtasksList.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] `SubtaskItem` component created under `src/presentation/components/subtaskItem/SubtaskItem.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] `CreateSubtaskForm` component created under `src/presentation/components/createSubtaskForm/CreateSubtaskForm.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] `EpicLinkSelector` component created under `src/presentation/components/epicLinkSelector/EpicLinkSelector.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] Components follow project conventions (arrow function, export default, `type` for props)

2. **Behavior & Data Flow**
   - [ ] `TicketOverview` displays core ticket information (title, description, status, epic, assignee, etc.) received via props
   - [ ] `TicketEditForm` handles editing of ticket fields and delegates submit/cancel actions via props (no direct usecases inside the component)
   - [ ] `SubtasksList` renders a list of `SubtaskItem` components based on props
   - [ ] `SubtaskItem` shows subtask title, completion status (checkbox), and exposes callbacks for toggle, edit, and delete via props
   - [ ] `CreateSubtaskForm` renders a form to create a subtask and delegates creation through props
   - [ ] `EpicLinkSelector` renders available epics and allows linking/unlinking via callbacks passed from the page

3. **Styling & UX**
   - [ ] All components use SCSS modules and variables from `src/styles/variables/*` (no hardcoded values or inline styles)
   - [ ] Ticket detail layout groups overview, edit form, subtasks, and epic link in a clear, responsive structure
   - [ ] Empty and loading states are supported for subtasks and epic link sections
   - [ ] Visual feedback is provided for saving, errors, and completed subtasks

4. **Accessibility & i18n**
   - [ ] All labels, headings, error messages, and helper texts use i18n with keys in `fr.json`
   - [ ] Forms use proper labels linked to inputs, with error messages using `role="alert"` and `aria-describedby`
   - [ ] Subtask checkboxes and epic selection controls are fully keyboard accessible and screen-reader friendly, using `shared/a11y/` utilities
   - [ ] Ticket detail page components use semantic HTML to structure sections and headings

5. **Clean Architecture & Testing**
   - [ ] Ticket page components are pure presentation and do not import usecases, repositories, or React Query hooks
   - [ ] Data fetching and mutations for ticket updates, subtasks, and epic linking live in hooks at the page/container level
   - [ ] No unit test needed

## Technical Considerations

- **Location**: `src/presentation/components/ticketOverview/`, `ticketEditForm/`, `subtasksList/`, `subtaskItem/`, `createSubtaskForm/`, `epicLinkSelector/`
- **Styling**: SCSS modules with shared variables from `src/styles/variables/*`
- **Forms**: Integrate with shared form patterns and validation based on domain schemas where appropriate (via hooks)
- **Accessibility**: Use `shared/a11y/` for form and list accessibility, especially for checkboxes and status messages
- **i18n**: Ticket-detail-specific texts grouped in dedicated translation namespaces

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Ticket detail components are implemented and integrated into the Ticket detail page
- [ ] All user-facing strings use i18n with keys added to `fr.json`
- [ ] Styles use SCSS modules and shared variables, with responsive layout verified
- [ ] Accessibility basics and form semantics are validated
- [ ] Tests for key ticket-detail behaviors are added or updated and pass
- [ ] Code passes linting, type-checking, and review
