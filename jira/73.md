## Description

Implement the Board page-specific components (BoardView, BoardColumn, TicketCard, ColumnsConfiguration, BoardFilters) to provide a Kanban-style board with drag-and-drop aligned with section 4.2 of the planning document.

## User Story

As a user, I want a visual board where I can see tickets organized by status and drag them between columns so that I can manage work in a Kanban-style workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Component Structure**
   - [ ] `BoardView` component created under `src/presentation/components/boardView/BoardView.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] `BoardColumn` component created under `src/presentation/components/boardColumn/BoardColumn.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] `TicketCard` component created under `src/presentation/components/ticketCard/TicketCard.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] `ColumnsConfiguration` component created under `src/presentation/components/columnsConfiguration/ColumnsConfiguration.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] `BoardFilters` component created under `src/presentation/components/boardFilters/BoardFilters.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] All components follow project conventions (arrow function, export default, `type` for props)

2. **Behavior & Drag-and-Drop**
   - [ ] `BoardView` renders columns using `BoardColumn` and integrates the existing drag-and-drop primitives (DraggableItem, DroppableZone)
   - [ ] Dragging a `TicketCard` between columns triggers callbacks provided via props (e.g., `onMoveTicket`) and does not contain usecase logic
   - [ ] Dragging and reordering within a column is supported and delegates to page-level hooks/usecases
   - [ ] `ColumnsConfiguration` exposes a UI (e.g., modal or panel) for enabling/disabling and reordering columns, delegating persistence to hooks
   - [ ] `BoardFilters` exposes board-level filters (status, assignee, epic, etc.) via props

3. **Styling, Layout & UX**
   - [ ] Board layout uses flex/grid to render columns horizontally with responsive behavior for smaller screens (horizontal scroll if needed)
   - [ ] All styles use SCSS modules with variables from `src/styles/variables/*` (no hardcoded values)
   - [ ] `TicketCard` visually distinguishes status, priority, and key ticket metadata
   - [ ] Drag-and-drop interactions include appropriate visual feedback (hover, dragging state, drop targets)

4. **Accessibility & i18n**
   - [ ] All headings, labels, and messages use the i18n system with keys in `fr.json`
   - [ ] Drag-and-drop integrates with `shared/a11y/` utilities where applicable (e.g., announcements for moves, focus management)
   - [ ] `TicketCard` is keyboard focusable and supports keyboard-based movement triggers (e.g., key-initiated move actions) where feasible
   - [ ] Columns use semantic structure (e.g., lists) and accessible names (column headers properly associated with their content)

5. **Clean Architecture & Testing**
   - [ ] Board components are pure presentation and do not import usecases, repositories, or React Query hooks
   - [ ] Board state, filters, and drag-and-drop orchestration live in hooks/stores outside of these components
   - [ ] No unit test needed

## Technical Considerations

- **Location**: `src/presentation/components/boardView/`, `boardColumn/`, `ticketCard/`, `columnsConfiguration/`, `boardFilters/`
- **Styling**: SCSS modules per component using variables from `src/styles/variables/*`
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Reuse existing shared drag-and-drop primitives and follow their patterns
- **Accessibility**: Ensure drag-and-drop does not break keyboard navigation; use `shared/a11y/` where possible
- **i18n**: Board-related labels, column names, and messages use translation keys

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Board components are implemented and integrated into the Board page
- [ ] Drag-and-drop interactions work for moving and reordering tickets
- [ ] All user-facing strings use i18n with keys added to `fr.json`
- [ ] Styles use SCSS modules and shared variables, with responsive layout verified
- [ ] Accessibility basics and drag feedback are verified
- [ ] Tests for core board behaviors are added or updated and pass
- [ ] Code passes linting, type-checking, and review
