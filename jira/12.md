# Jest Configuration

- Type: Task
- Priority: High
- Story Points: 2
- Labels: setup, testing, jest, configuration
- Git Branch: `feat/workbench-12-jest-configuration`

## Description

Configure Jest as the unit testing framework with TypeScript support to enable reliable and fast feedback on domain and usecase logic.

## User Story

As a developer, I want Jest configured with TypeScript support so that I can write and run unit tests consistently across the project.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Jest installed and added to devDependencies
- [ ] Jest configuration file created with TypeScript integration
- [ ] Tests can be executed via `yarn test` or equivalent script
- [ ] Coverage collection enabled for domain and usecases layers

## Technical Considerations

- Domain: test domain entities and business rules
- Usecases: test usecases with mocked repositories
- Infrastructure: not directly tested here (covered via usecases)
- Presentation: no direct Jest configuration needed (React Testing Library will build on this)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Jest installed and configured with TypeScript
- [ ] Jest config file committed (e.g. jest.config.ts)
- [ ] `yarn test` runs successfully with a sample test
- [ ] Documentation added to README or docs/plan.md on how to run tests
- [ ] No impact on existing build or linting pipeline

## Related Components

- Files: `package.json`, `jest.config.ts` (or equivalent), `tsconfig.json`
- Dependencies: `jest`, `ts-jest`, `@types/jest`
