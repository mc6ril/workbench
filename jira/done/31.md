# Create Type Utilities

- Type: Task
- Priority: Medium
- Story Points: 2
- Labels: typescript, utilities, types, shared, foundation
- Git Branch: `feat/workbench-31-type-utilities`

## Description

Create common TypeScript utility types and helpers in `shared/utils/` to reduce code duplication and improve type safety across the application.

## User Story

As a developer, I want common TypeScript utility types and helpers so that I can write more maintainable and type-safe code without duplicating type definitions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Common Utility Types**
  - [ ] Create `shared/utils/types.ts` file
  - [ ] Define common utility types:
    - [ ] `Nullable<T>` - Make type nullable
    - [ ] `Optional<T>` - Make type optional
    - [ ] `DeepPartial<T>` - Make all properties optional recursively
    - [ ] `DeepRequired<T>` - Make all properties required recursively
    - [ ] `KeysOfType<T, U>` - Get keys of type T that have value type U
    - [ ] `PickByType<T, U>` - Pick properties of type T with value type U
    - [ ] `OmitByType<T, U>` - Omit properties of type T with value type U

- [ ] **Array Utilities**
  - [ ] Define array utility types:
    - [ ] `ArrayElement<T>` - Get element type from array
    - [ ] `NonEmptyArray<T>` - Array with at least one element
    - [ ] `ReadonlyArray<T>` - Readonly array type

- [ ] **Object Utilities**
  - [ ] Define object utility types:
    - [ ] `Keys<T>` - Get keys of type T
    - [ ] `Values<T>` - Get values of type T
    - [ ] `Entries<T>` - Get entries of type T
    - [ ] `RequiredKeys<T>` - Get required keys of type T
    - [ ] `OptionalKeys<T>` - Get optional keys of type T

- [ ] **Function Utilities**
  - [ ] Define function utility types:
    - [ ] `Parameters<T>` - Get parameters of function type T
    - [ ] `ReturnType<T>` - Get return type of function type T
    - [ ] `AsyncReturnType<T>` - Get return type of async function type T

- [ ] **Type Guards**
  - [ ] Update `shared/utils/guard.ts` file
  - [ ] Define common type guard functions:
    - [ ] `isDefined<T>(value: T | undefined | null): value is T`
    - [ ] `isNotNull<T>(value: T | null): value is T`
    - [ ] `isNotUndefined<T>(value: T | undefined): value is T`
    - [ ] `isString(value: unknown): value is string`
    - [ ] `isNumber(value: unknown): value is number`
    - [ ] `isArray<T>(value: unknown): value is T[]`

- [ ] **File Organization**
  - [ ] Utility types in `shared/utils/types.ts`
  - [ ] Type guards in `shared/utils/guard.ts`
  - [ ] All utilities exported and documented
  - [ ] TypeScript types properly defined

## Technical Considerations

- **Shared Layer** (`shared/utils/`):
  - Create `types.ts` for utility types
  - Update `guards.ts` for type guard functions
  - All utilities are pure TypeScript types or functions
  - All utilities properly typed and documented

- **Type Utilities**:
  - Utility types use TypeScript advanced types (mapped types, conditional types)
  - Utility types are generic and reusable
  - Utility types follow TypeScript best practices

- **Type Guards**:
  - Type guards are runtime functions that narrow types
  - Type guards return type predicates
  - Type guards are useful for runtime type checking

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Common utility types defined
- [ ] Array utility types defined
- [ ] Object utility types defined
- [ ] Function utility types defined
- [ ] Type guard functions implemented
- [ ] All utilities properly typed with TypeScript
- [ ] All utilities documented with JSDoc
- [ ] Utilities organized in `shared/utils/` directory
- [ ] Code review completed

## Related Components

- `src/shared/utils/types.ts` - Utility types file
- `src/shared/utils/guards.ts` - Type guard functions file
- `src/shared/utils/index.ts` - Export utilities (if needed)

## Dependencies

- None (standalone utilities)

## Notes

- Focus on commonly used utility types and type guards
- Consider future needs when defining utilities
- Utilities should be generic and reusable
- Document usage examples in JSDoc comments
- Consider using existing TypeScript utility types from lib (e.g., `Partial`, `Required`, `Pick`, `Omit`)
