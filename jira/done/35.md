# App Constants

**Type:** Task  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Story Points:** 2  
**Labels:** setup, constants, shared  
**Git Branch:** `feat/workbench-35-app-constants`

## Description

Define application-wide constants for routes, keys, limits, and other shared values. This centralizes configuration and ensures consistency across the application.

## User Story

As a developer, I want to have application-wide constants for routes, keys, and limits so that I can maintain consistent configuration without hardcoding values throughout the codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Constants file created at `shared/constants/app.ts`
2. Route constants defined for all application routes
3. Storage keys constants for localStorage/sessionStorage
4. Application limits constants (pagination, max lengths, etc.)
5. All constants properly typed and exported

## Technical Considerations

- **Shared Layer**: Constants in `shared/constants/app.ts` can be imported by all layers
- **Route Constants**: Define all routes as constants for type safety and refactoring
- **Storage Keys**: Centralize storage keys to avoid conflicts
- **Type Safety**: All constants properly typed with TypeScript

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Constants file created
- [ ] Route constants defined for all routes
- [ ] Storage keys constants defined
- [ ] Application limits constants defined
- [ ] All constants properly typed
- [ ] Documentation added for constant usage

## Related Components

- `shared/constants/app.ts`
- `shared/constants/routes.ts`
- All components using routes or storage keys
