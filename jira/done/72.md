## Description

Implement the Backlog page-specific components (TicketList, TicketListItem, TicketFilters, TicketSort, BulkActions, CreateTicketForm) to provide a full-featured backlog experience aligned with section 4.2 of the planning document.

## User Story

As a user, I want a Backlog page where I can browse, filter, sort, create, and bulk-manage tickets so that I can efficiently manage my pending work.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Component Structure**
   - [ ] `TicketList` component created under `src/presentation/components/ticketList/TicketList.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] `TicketListItem` component created under `src/presentation/components/ticketListItem/TicketListItem.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] `TicketFilters` component created under `src/presentation/components/ticketFilters/TicketFilters.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] `TicketSort` component created under `src/presentation/components/ticketSort/TicketSort.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] `BulkActions` component created under `src/presentation/components/bulkActions/BulkActions.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] `CreateTicketForm` component created under `src/presentation/components/createTicketForm/CreateTicketForm.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] All components follow project conventions (arrow function, export default, `type` for props, no business logic)

2. **Behavior & Data Flow**
   - [ ] `TicketList` receives a list of tickets and renders `TicketListItem` children without performing data fetching
   - [ ] `TicketListItem` displays ticket core fields (title, status, epic, etc.) and exposes callbacks (edit, open, select) via props
   - [ ] `TicketFilters` exposes selected filter values and change handlers via props (search text, status, epic)
   - [ ] `TicketSort` exposes current sort configuration and changes via props (by date, title, status)
   - [ ] `BulkActions` exposes callbacks for bulk operations (delete, move, change status) and uses selection state passed from the page
   - [ ] `CreateTicketForm` renders a ticket creation form and delegates persistence to a usecase via hooks in the page

3. **Styling & UX**
   - [ ] All styles use SCSS modules with variables from `src/styles/variables/*` (no hardcoded colors, spacing, or font sizes)
   - [ ] Components follow BEM naming (kebab-case, `__` elements, `--` modifiers)
   - [ ] Backlog layout is responsive and usable on desktop and mobile
   - [ ] Empty, loading, and error states are integrated using reusable feedback components where appropriate

4. **Accessibility & i18n**
   - [ ] All labels, placeholders, and messages use i18n (`useTranslation()` and keys in `fr.json`)
   - [ ] Filter and sort controls have proper labels and ARIA attributes for screen readers
   - [ ] Bulk selection uses accessible checkboxes and clearly indicates selected items and available actions
   - [ ] Keyboard navigation supports moving through the list, toggling selection, and using bulk actions

5. **Clean Architecture & Testing**
   - [ ] Components are presentation-only and do not import usecases, repositories, or React Query hooks
   - [ ] Data fetching, sorting, filtering, and mutations are implemented in page-level hooks and stores, not in these components
   - [ ] No unit test needed

## Technical Considerations

- **Location**: `src/presentation/components/ticketList/`, `ticketListItem/`, `ticketFilters/`, `ticketSort/`, `bulkActions/`, `createTicketForm/`
- **Styling**: Use SCSS modules and variables from `src/styles/variables/*`; no inline styles
- **State**: Filtering/sorting/selection state lives in hooks and/or Zustand stores, not in these components
- **Accessibility**: Use `shared/a11y/` utilities for ARIA attributes and IDs, especially for list items and bulk selection
- **i18n**: Shared translation namespace for backlog-related labels and messages

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All backlog components are implemented and integrated into the Backlog page
- [ ] Components follow project conventions and Clean Architecture boundaries
- [ ] All user-facing strings use i18n with keys added to `fr.json`
- [ ] Styles use SCSS modules and shared variables with verified responsive behavior
- [ ] Accessibility basics (labels, keyboard navigation, focus) are validated
- [ ] Tests for core backlog behaviors are added or updated and pass
- [ ] Code passes linting, type-checking, and review
