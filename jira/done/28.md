# Create Accessibility Utilities

- Type: Task
- Priority: High
- Story Points: 3
- Labels: accessibility, a11y, utilities, shared, foundation
- Git Branch: `feat/workbench-28-a11y-utilities`

## Description

Create accessibility utilities and helper functions in `shared/a11y/` to centralize accessibility logic and ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across the application.

## User Story

As a developer, I want centralized accessibility utilities so that I can easily implement accessible features and maintain consistency across the application.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Accessibility Utilities**
  - [ ] Create `shared/a11y/utilities.ts` file
  - [ ] Implement utility functions for common accessibility patterns:
    - [ ] Focus management utilities (trap focus, return focus)
    - [ ] ARIA attribute helpers
    - [ ] Keyboard event handlers
    - [ ] Screen reader announcement helpers
  - [ ] All utilities are pure functions (no side effects)
  - [ ] All utilities are properly typed with TypeScript

- [ ] **Focus Management**
  - [ ] `trapFocus(element: HTMLElement): () => void` - Trap focus within element
  - [ ] `returnFocus(element: HTMLElement): void` - Return focus to element
  - [ ] `focusFirstFocusable(element: HTMLElement): void` - Focus first focusable element
  - [ ] `focusLastFocusable(element: HTMLElement): void` - Focus last focusable element

- [ ] **ARIA Helpers**
  - [ ] `setAriaLabel(element: HTMLElement, label: string): void` - Set aria-label
  - [ ] `setAriaDescribedBy(element: HTMLElement, id: string): void` - Set aria-describedby
  - [ ] `setAriaLive(element: HTMLElement, polite: 'polite' | 'assertive'): void` - Set aria-live
  - [ ] `announceToScreenReader(message: string, priority: 'polite' | 'assertive'): void` - Announce to screen reader

- [ ] **Keyboard Helpers**
  - [ ] `isEscapeKey(event: KeyboardEvent): boolean` - Check if Escape key
  - [ ] `isEnterKey(event: KeyboardEvent): boolean` - Check if Enter key
  - [ ] `isSpaceKey(event: KeyboardEvent): boolean` - Check if Space key
  - [ ] `handleKeyboardNavigation(event: KeyboardEvent, handlers: KeyboardHandlers): void` - Handle keyboard navigation

- [ ] **File Organization**
  - [ ] Utilities organized in `shared/a11y/utilities.ts`
  - [ ] All functions exported and documented with JSDoc
  - [ ] TypeScript types defined for all parameters and return values
  - [ ] Functions follow single responsibility principle

## Technical Considerations

- **Shared Layer** (`shared/a11y/utilities.ts`):
  - Create utility functions for accessibility patterns
  - All functions are pure (no side effects where possible)
  - All functions properly typed with TypeScript
  - Functions documented with JSDoc comments
  - Functions can be imported by all layers (domain, usecases, infrastructure, presentation)

- **TypeScript Types**:
  - Define types for keyboard handlers
  - Define types for ARIA attributes
  - Define types for focus management options

- **No External Dependencies**:
  - Utilities should be pure TypeScript/JavaScript
  - No React dependencies (utilities can be used outside React)
  - No infrastructure dependencies

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Focus management utilities implemented
- [ ] ARIA helper utilities implemented
- [ ] Keyboard helper utilities implemented
- [ ] Screen reader announcement utilities implemented
- [ ] All utilities properly typed with TypeScript
- [ ] All utilities documented with JSDoc
- [ ] Utilities organized in `shared/a11y/utilities.ts`
- [ ] No external dependencies (pure TypeScript)
- [ ] Code review completed

## Related Components

- `src/shared/a11y/utilities.ts` - Accessibility utilities file
- `src/shared/a11y/index.ts` - Export utilities (if needed)

## Dependencies

- None (standalone utilities)

## Notes

- Utilities should be framework-agnostic (no React dependencies)
- Focus on common accessibility patterns (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- Consider future needs (live regions, announcements, etc.)
- Utilities should be testable and pure functions where possible
- Document usage examples in JSDoc comments
