## Description

Implement the Home dashboard page-specific components (DashboardHeader, QuickAddTicket, MyWorkWidget, RecentActivityWidget, ShortcutsWidget) to provide a meaningful at-a-glance view and quick actions aligned with the planning document section 4.2.

## User Story

As a user, I want a Home dashboard with quick actions and personalized widgets so that I can quickly see my work, recent activity, and navigate to key areas of the application.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Component Structure**
   - [ ] `DashboardHeader` component created under `src/presentation/components/dashboardHeader/DashboardHeader.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] `QuickAddTicket` component created under `src/presentation/components/quickAddTicket/QuickAddTicket.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] `MyWorkWidget` component created under `src/presentation/components/myWorkWidget/MyWorkWidget.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] `RecentActivityWidget` component created under `src/presentation/components/recentActivityWidget/RecentActivityWidget.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] `ShortcutsWidget` component created under `src/presentation/components/shortcutsWidget/ShortcutsWidget.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] Each component follows project conventions (arrow function, export default, `type` for props, no business logic)

2. **Behavior & Data Flow**
   - [ ] Components receive data and callbacks via props from the Home page (no direct React Query or Supabase calls)
   - [ ] `QuickAddTicket` exposes a minimal, inline ticket creation UX that delegates actual creation to a usecase via a hook in the page
   - [ ] `MyWorkWidget` displays a list or summary of the user’s active tickets based on props
   - [ ] `RecentActivityWidget` displays recent activity items based on props (tickets updated/created)
   - [ ] `ShortcutsWidget` renders navigation shortcuts using route constants from the shared layer

3. **Styling & Layout**
   - [ ] All styles use SCSS modules co-located with components and variables from `src/styles/variables/*` (no hardcoded values, no inline styles)
   - [ ] Components use BEM naming (kebab-case, `__` elements, `--` modifiers)
   - [ ] Layout is responsive for desktop and mobile according to existing layout conventions
   - [ ] Visual design is consistent with reusable UI components (Button, Card, etc.)

4. **Accessibility & i18n**
   - [ ] All user-facing texts use the i18n system (`useTranslation()` and keys in `src/shared/i18n/messages/fr.json`)
   - [ ] Interactive elements (buttons, links, quick actions) have proper ARIA attributes and labels using utilities from `shared/a11y/`
   - [ ] Widgets and header use semantic HTML (e.g., appropriate heading levels, sections)
   - [ ] Keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements, with visible focus states

5. **Clean Architecture & Testing**
   - [ ] Components are presentation-only with no domain or infrastructure logic
   - [ ] Any data fetching or mutations happen in page-level hooks, not inside these components
   - [ ] No unit test needed

## Technical Considerations

- **Location**: `src/presentation/components/dashboardHeader/`, `quickAddTicket/`, `myWorkWidget/`, `recentActivityWidget/`, `shortcutsWidget/`
- **Styling**: SCSS modules per component, using variables from `src/styles/variables/*`
- **Architecture**: Components are pure presentation; orchestration lives in pages and hooks
- **Accessibility**: Use utilities from `shared/a11y/` for IDs and ARIA attributes
- **i18n**: Centralize translation keys for Home dashboard texts under an appropriate namespace

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All Home dashboard components are implemented and wired into the Home page
- [ ] Components respect Clean Architecture (no business logic, no direct Supabase/React Query)
- [ ] All user-facing strings use i18n with keys added to `fr.json`
- [ ] Styles use SCSS modules and shared variables, with responsive behavior verified
- [ ] Accessibility basics are verified (labels, focus, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Tests for key behaviors are added or updated and pass
- [ ] Code passes linting, type-checking, and review
