# Loading & Status Handling

**Type:** Task  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Labels:** setup, observability, shared, ui  
**Git Branch:** `feat/workbench-34-loading-status-handling`

## Description

Create shared loading, error, and empty-state patterns for React Query and UI components. This provides consistent user feedback for async operations and data states.

## User Story

As a developer, I want to have shared loading, error, and empty-state patterns so that I can provide consistent user feedback for async operations without duplicating UI code.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Loading state utilities and components created for React Query hooks
2. Error state utilities and components for displaying errors consistently
3. Empty state utilities and components for displaying empty data states
4. React Query hook wrappers for consistent data/loading/error patterns
5. Reusable UI components for loading spinners, error messages, and empty states

## Technical Considerations

- **Shared Layer**: Status handling utilities in `shared/utils/` can be imported by all layers
- **React Query**: Integrate with React Query hooks for loading/error states
- **UI Components**: Create reusable components in `presentation/components/ui/` for loading, error, and empty states
- **Consistency**: All async operations should use the same loading/error/empty patterns

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Loading state utilities and components created
- [ ] Error state utilities and components created
- [ ] Empty state utilities and components created
- [ ] React Query hook wrappers for consistent patterns
- [ ] Reusable UI components for loading, error, and empty states
- [ ] Documentation added for status handling patterns

## Related Components

- `shared/utils/status.ts`
- `presentation/components/ui/LoadingSpinner.tsx`
- `presentation/components/ui/ErrorMessage.tsx`
- `presentation/components/ui/EmptyState.tsx`
- `presentation/hooks/*` (React Query hooks)
