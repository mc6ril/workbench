## Description

Implement the Settings page-specific components (SettingsLayout, ProjectSettings, StatusesColumnsSettings, PrioritiesSettings, ExportImportSettings) to provide a structured configuration area aligned with section 4.2 of the planning document.

## User Story

As a user, I want a Settings area where I can configure project settings, workflow statuses/columns, priorities, and data export/import so that I can adapt the board to my needs and manage data safely.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Component Structure**
   - [ ] `SettingsLayout` component created under `src/presentation/components/settingsLayout/SettingsLayout.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] `ProjectSettings` component created under `src/presentation/components/projectSettings/ProjectSettings.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] `StatusesColumnsSettings` component created under `src/presentation/components/statusesColumnsSettings/StatusesColumnsSettings.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] `PrioritiesSettings` component created under `src/presentation/components/prioritiesSettings/PrioritiesSettings.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] `ExportImportSettings` component created under `src/presentation/components/exportImportSettings/ExportImportSettings.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] Components follow project conventions (arrow function, export default, `type` for props)

2. **Behavior & Data Flow**
   - [ ] `SettingsLayout` provides navigation tabs/sections for each settings area and renders the active section via children or composition
   - [ ] `ProjectSettings` displays and edits project-level configuration via props and callbacks (no direct usecases inside the component)
   - [ ] `StatusesColumnsSettings` renders the board statuses/columns configuration UI (create, rename, reorder, enable/disable) and delegates actions to hooks
   - [ ] `PrioritiesSettings` renders priority levels and allows configuration via props and callbacks
   - [ ] `ExportImportSettings` exposes controls for exporting and importing data; actual IO is implemented in hooks/usecases not in the component

3. **Styling & UX**
   - [ ] All components use SCSS modules with variables from `src/styles/variables/*` (no hardcoded values or inline styles)
   - [ ] Settings layout clearly separates navigation and content areas, with a responsive design
   - [ ] Forms and tables used in settings have consistent styling with the rest of the application
   - [ ] Feedback is provided for saving, errors, and long-running export/import operations

4. **Accessibility & i18n**
   - [ ] All user-facing texts (labels, section titles, button texts, error messages) use i18n with keys in `fr.json`
   - [ ] Settings navigation uses semantic and accessible patterns (e.g., tabs with appropriate roles and ARIA attributes)
   - [ ] Forms and interactive controls use proper labels, `aria-*` attributes, and associations, leveraging `shared/a11y/`
   - [ ] Export/import actions provide clear feedback for screen readers (e.g., live regions for progress or completion)

5. **Clean Architecture & Testing**
   - [ ] Settings components are pure presentation and do not import usecases, repositories, or React Query hooks
   - [ ] All configuration, export, and import logic lives in hooks/usecases and is passed into these components via props
   - [ ] No unit test needed

## Technical Considerations

- **Location**: `src/presentation/components/settingsLayout/`, `projectSettings/`, `statusesColumnsSettings/`, `prioritiesSettings/`, `exportImportSettings/`
- **Styling**: SCSS modules per component, using shared variables from `src/styles/variables/*`
- **Navigation**: Settings navigation should reuse or align with existing navigation and layout patterns
- **Accessibility**: Use `shared/a11y/` utilities for tab roles, labels, and status messages
- **i18n**: Settings-related texts organized under an appropriate i18n namespace

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Settings components are implemented and integrated into the Settings pages
- [ ] All user-facing strings use i18n with keys added to `fr.json`
- [ ] Styles use SCSS modules and shared variables with responsive behavior verified
- [ ] Accessibility basics and navigation patterns are validated
- [ ] Tests for key settings behaviors are added or updated and pass
- [ ] Code passes linting, type-checking, and review
