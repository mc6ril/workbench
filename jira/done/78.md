## Title

Implement navigation layout components (SidebarNavigation, SkipLink, Breadcrumbs)

## Type

Feature

## Priority

Medium

## Story Points

5

## Labels

- presentation
- layout
- navigation
- accessibility

## Git Branch

`feat/workbench-78-layout-navigation-components`

## Description

Create the navigation-related layout components listed in section 4.3 (Layout/Navigation): a sidebar navigation for project routes, a skip link for accessibility, and breadcrumbs for navigation context.

## User Story

As a user, I want clear navigation and context (sidebar + breadcrumbs) so that I can move between project views quickly and understand where I am.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Sidebar Navigation**
   - [ ] Create `src/presentation/components/sidebarNavigation/SidebarNavigation.tsx` with its SCSS module
   - [ ] Sidebar contains routes for: Home, Backlog, Board, Epics, Settings (project-scoped)
   - [ ] Active route is visually and semantically indicated (e.g., `aria-current="page"` for the current link)
   - [ ] Sidebar is keyboard navigable and uses semantic `<nav>` structure

2. **Skip Link**
   - [ ] Create `src/presentation/components/skipLink/SkipLink.tsx` with its SCSS module
   - [ ] Skip link targets the main content container (e.g., `#main-content`) and becomes visible on focus
   - [ ] Skip link label uses i18n (no hardcoded strings)

3. **Breadcrumbs**
   - [ ] Create `src/presentation/components/breadcrumbs/Breadcrumbs.tsx` with its SCSS module
   - [ ] Breadcrumbs renders a hierarchical trail for project routes (at minimum: Project > Current view)
   - [ ] Breadcrumbs uses proper semantics (`nav` with `aria-label`, list structure)

4. **Integration**
   - [ ] SidebarNavigation, SkipLink, and Breadcrumbs are integrated into the project dashboard shell (e.g., `src/app/(auth)/[projectId]/layout.tsx` or a dedicated presentation layout component)

5. **Accessibility & i18n**
   - [ ] All user-facing texts use i18n keys added to `src/shared/i18n/messages/fr.json`
   - [ ] All interactive elements use centralized accessibility IDs and utilities from `shared/a11y/` (no inline IDs)

6. **Clean Architecture**
   - [ ] Components are pure presentation: no usecase/repository/Supabase imports, no React Query hooks

## Technical Considerations

- **Location**:
  - `src/presentation/components/sidebarNavigation/`
  - `src/presentation/components/skipLink/`
  - `src/presentation/components/breadcrumbs/`
- **Routing**:
  - Prefer Next.js `Link` for navigation.
  - Ensure project-scoped URLs include `[projectId]` segment consistently.
- **A11y**:
  - Skip link must target a stable `id` on the main content container.
  - Sidebar should be a `<nav>` landmark; breadcrumbs should use `aria-label`.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] SidebarNavigation, SkipLink, and Breadcrumbs are implemented and rendered in the project shell
- [ ] i18n keys added for all visible labels
- [ ] Accessibility validated (keyboard navigation, focus states, landmarks)
- [ ] Styling uses SCSS modules and shared variables only
- [ ] Code passes linting and type-checking
