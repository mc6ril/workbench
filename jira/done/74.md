## Description

Implement the Epics page-specific components (EpicsList, EpicCard, CreateEpicForm, EpicDetail, EpicProgress) to provide an overview and management UI for epics, aligned with section 4.2 of the planning document.

## User Story

As a user, I want to view, create, and manage epics so that I can group related tickets and track progress at a higher level.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Component Structure**
   - [ ] `EpicsList` component created under `src/presentation/components/epicsList/EpicsList.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] `EpicCard` component created under `src/presentation/components/epicCard/EpicCard.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] `CreateEpicForm` component created under `src/presentation/components/createEpicForm/CreateEpicForm.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] `EpicDetail` component created under `src/presentation/components/epicDetail/EpicDetail.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] `EpicProgress` component created under `src/presentation/components/epicProgress/EpicProgress.tsx` with its own SCSS module
   - [ ] Components follow project conventions (arrow function, export default, `type` for props)

2. **Behavior & Data Flow**
   - [ ] `EpicsList` receives a list of epics and renders `EpicCard` items without performing data fetching
   - [ ] `EpicCard` displays name, description, and progress (via `EpicProgress`) and exposes callbacks (view detail, edit, delete) via props
   - [ ] `CreateEpicForm` renders a form for epic creation and delegates persistence to hooks/usecases at the page level
   - [ ] `EpicDetail` receives an epic and related tickets via props and renders a detailed view (including progress and linked tickets)
   - [ ] `EpicProgress` displays completion percentage and basic visual representation based on props

3. **Styling & UX**
   - [ ] All styles use SCSS modules and variables from `src/styles/variables/*` (no hardcoded values)
   - [ ] Layout works for a grid/list view of epics and a detailed view for a single epic
   - [ ] Visual hierarchy clearly differentiates epic title, status/progress, and meta information
   - [ ] Empty, loading, and error states are supported using shared feedback components

4. **Accessibility & i18n**
   - [ ] All user-facing texts (labels, messages, headings) use i18n with keys in `fr.json`
   - [ ] Components use semantic HTML and heading levels appropriate to the page structure
   - [ ] Progress information is exposed using ARIA attributes where appropriate (e.g., progressbar semantics)
   - [ ] Interactive elements (buttons, links) have keyboard and screen reader support, leveraging `shared/a11y/` utilities

5. **Clean Architecture & Testing**
   - [ ] Epics components are pure presentation and do not import usecases, repositories, or React Query hooks
   - [ ] Data loading and mutation logic live in hooks and page-level containers
   - [ ] No unit test needed

## Technical Considerations

- **Location**: `src/presentation/components/epicsList/`, `epicCard/`, `createEpicForm/`, `epicDetail/`, `epicProgress/`
- **Styling**: SCSS modules per component with shared variables from `src/styles/variables/*`
- **Architecture**: Presentation-only components wired to usecases via hooks in pages
- **Accessibility**: Use `shared/a11y/` for ARIA attributes, especially for progress representation
- **i18n**: Epics-related labels and messages use dedicated translation keys

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Epics components are implemented and integrated into the Epics pages
- [ ] All user-facing strings use i18n with keys added to `fr.json`
- [ ] Styles use SCSS modules and shared variables with responsive behavior verified
- [ ] Accessibility basics and progress semantics are validated
- [ ] Tests for core epics behaviors are added or updated and pass
- [ ] Code passes linting, type-checking, and review
