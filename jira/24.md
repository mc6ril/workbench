# Standardize Presentation Hooks Naming Convention

- Type: Refactoring
- Priority: Medium
- Story Points: 5
- Labels: refactoring, hooks, react-query, standardization, architecture
- Git Branch: `feat/workbench-24-standardize-hooks-naming`

## Description

Refactor presentation hooks to follow a standardized naming convention that clearly indicates project-scoped data. This prevents generic hooks from growing and becoming unmanageable, and improves code clarity and maintainability.

## User Story

As a developer, I want standardized hook naming conventions for project-scoped data so that I can easily understand hook purposes and avoid creating unmanageable generic hooks.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Hook Naming Standardization**
  - [ ] Rename/refactor hooks to follow convention:
    - [ ] `useProject(projectId)` - Project data (already exists, verify naming)
    - [ ] `useProjectTickets(projectId, filters?)` - Tickets for a project (rename from `useTickets`)
    - [ ] `useProjectEpics(projectId)` - Epics for a project (create new)
    - [ ] `useProjectMembers(projectId)` - Members for a project (create placeholder for future)
  - [ ] All hooks follow the `useProject*` pattern for project-scoped data
  - [ ] All hooks accept `projectId` as first parameter
  - [ ] Optional filters parameter for hooks that support filtering

- [ ] **Query Keys Update**
  - [ ] Update `queryKeys.ts` to reflect new hook naming
  - [ ] Ensure query keys follow hierarchical pattern: `["projects", projectId, "tickets"]`, etc.
  - [ ] Maintain backward compatibility during migration (if needed)

- [ ] **Hook Implementation**
  - [ ] `useProject(projectId)` - Verify current implementation matches convention
  - [ ] `useProjectTickets(projectId, filters?)` - Refactor from `useTickets(projectId)`
    - [ ] Add optional `filters` parameter for future filtering support
    - [ ] Update query key to use new naming
    - [ ] Update hook documentation
  - [ ] `useProjectEpics(projectId)` - Create new hook
    - [ ] Follow same pattern as `useProjectTickets`
    - [ ] Use appropriate usecase (create if needed)
    - [ ] Add to exports in `index.ts`
  - [ ] `useProjectMembers(projectId)` - Create placeholder hook
    - [ ] Add hook structure (can be minimal implementation)
    - [ ] Add to exports in `index.ts`
    - [ ] Document as "future implementation"

- [ ] **Update All Usages**
  - [ ] Find all usages of `useTickets` in codebase
  - [ ] Update to `useProjectTickets` with proper `projectId` parameter
  - [ ] Verify all hook usages follow new convention
  - [ ] Update any TypeScript types if needed

- [ ] **Documentation**
  - [ ] Update hook documentation to reflect new naming convention
  - [ ] Document the naming convention pattern for future hooks
  - [ ] Add JSDoc comments explaining the convention

## Technical Considerations

- **Presentation Layer** (`presentation/hooks/`):
  - Refactor `useTickets` → `useProjectTickets` in `presentation/hooks/ticket/`
  - Create `useProjectEpics` in `presentation/hooks/epic/` (new directory)
  - Create `useProjectMembers` in `presentation/hooks/project/` (or new `member/` directory)
  - Update `index.ts` exports
  - All hooks must follow Clean Architecture (call usecases, not infrastructure directly)

- **Query Keys** (`presentation/hooks/queryKeys.ts`):
  - Update query keys to match new hook naming
  - Ensure hierarchical structure: `["projects", projectId, "tickets"]`
  - Add query keys for epics and members

- **Core Layer** (`core/usecases/`):
  - Verify usecases exist for epics (create if needed)
  - Verify usecases exist for members (create if needed)
  - Usecases should follow existing patterns (take repository as parameter)

- **Infrastructure Layer** (`infrastructure/supabase/`):
  - Verify repositories exist for epics (create if needed)
  - Verify repositories exist for members (create if needed)
  - Repositories should implement ports from `core/ports/`

- **Pages** (`app/`):
  - Update all page components using old hook names
  - Ensure all hook calls use new naming convention
  - Verify no breaking changes in functionality

## Definition of Done

- [ ] `useTickets` renamed to `useProjectTickets` with `projectId` parameter
- [ ] `useProjectEpics` hook created following same pattern
- [ ] `useProjectMembers` placeholder hook created
- [ ] Query keys updated to reflect new naming
- [ ] All hook usages updated throughout codebase
- [ ] All hooks follow `useProject*` naming convention
- [ ] Hook documentation updated
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No ESLint errors
- [ ] All existing tests pass (update if needed)
- [ ] Code review completed

## Related Components

- `src/presentation/hooks/project/useProject.ts` - Verify naming matches convention
- `src/presentation/hooks/ticket/useTickets.ts` - Rename to `useProjectTickets`
- `src/presentation/hooks/queryKeys.ts` - Update query keys
- `src/presentation/hooks/index.ts` - Update exports
- `src/app/(auth)/workspace/page.tsx` - Update hook usage
- `src/app/(auth)/[projectId]/page.tsx` - Update hook usage (if exists)
- `src/core/usecases/epic/` - Create usecases for epics (if needed)
- `src/core/usecases/member/` - Create usecases for members (if needed)
- `src/core/ports/epicRepository.ts` - Create port for epics (if needed)
- `src/core/ports/memberRepository.ts` - Create port for members (if needed)

## Dependencies

- None (standalone refactoring task)

## Notes

- This is a refactoring task focused on naming conventions, not new functionality
- Maintain backward compatibility during migration if possible
- The `useProjectMembers` hook can be a minimal placeholder for future implementation
- Follow existing hook patterns (React Query, usecases, repositories)
- Ensure all hooks maintain the same functionality, only naming changes
- Consider creating a hooks naming convention document for future reference
