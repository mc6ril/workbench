## Description

Create a reusable Link component in `presentation/components/ui/Link.tsx` that wraps Next.js Link component for consistent navigation styling and behavior. The component must follow project conventions and include full accessibility support.

## User Story

As a developer, I want a reusable Link component with Next.js integration so that I can create consistent navigation links across the application with proper client-side routing.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Component Structure**
   - [ ] Link component created in `presentation/components/ui/Link.tsx`
   - [ ] Component follows project conventions (arrow function, export default, `type` for props)
   - [ ] Component accepts props: `href`, `children`, `variant`, `external` (optional), `ariaLabel`, and passes through other Next.js Link props
   - [ ] Component uses SCSS variables from `styles/variables/*` for all styling values
   - [ ] Component SCSS file created in `src/styles/components/ui/Link.module.scss`

2. **Next.js Integration**
   - [ ] Wraps Next.js `Link` component from `next/link`
   - [ ] Supports internal navigation (client-side routing)
   - [ ] Supports external links (with `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` when `external` is true)
   - [ ] Preserves Next.js Link behavior (prefetching, etc.)

3. **Variants**
   - [ ] Default variant: standard link styling
   - [ ] Primary variant: emphasized link
   - [ ] Secondary variant: subtle link
   - [ ] Button variant (optional): link styled as button

4. **States**
   - [ ] Default state: normal link appearance
   - [ ] Hover state: visual feedback on hover
   - [ ] Active state: visual feedback for active/current route (if applicable)
   - [ ] Focus state: visible focus outline
   - [ ] Visited state (optional): different styling for visited links

5. **Accessibility**
   - [ ] Proper semantic element (`<a>` tag via Next.js Link)
   - [ ] `aria-label` or descriptive text for all links
   - [ ] For external links: `aria-label` indicates external link (e.g., "Opens in new tab")
   - [ ] Keyboard navigation: Tab key moves focus, Enter activates link
   - [ ] Focus indicators: visible focus outline
   - [ ] External links: `target="_blank"` with `rel="noopener noreferrer"` and accessible warning
   - [ ] Accessibility IDs use centralized utilities from `shared/a11y/`

6. **Styling**
   - [ ] All colors use SCSS variables (no hardcoded values)
   - [ ] All spacing uses SCSS variables
   - [ ] All font sizes use SCSS variables
   - [ ] Uses BEM methodology for class names (kebab-case, `__` for elements, `--` for modifiers)
   - [ ] No inline CSS
   - [ ] No `!important`
   - [ ] Underline on hover (standard link pattern) or variant-specific styling

7. **TypeScript**
   - [ ] Props typed with `type` (not `interface`)
   - [ ] Explicit return type for component
   - [ ] Proper TypeScript types for all props
   - [ ] Extends Next.js Link props appropriately
   - [ ] No `any` types
   - [ ] Support for `React.ReactNode` as children

8. **Component Export**
   - [ ] Component exported as default
   - [ ] Component can be imported from `@/presentation/components/ui/Link`

## Technical Considerations

- **Location**: `src/presentation/components/ui/Link.tsx`
- **SCSS**: `src/styles/components/ui/Link.module.scss`
- **SCSS Variables**: Add link-related variables to `styles/variables/colors.scss` and `styles/variables/spacing.scss` if needed
- **Next.js**: Uses `next/link` for client-side routing
- **Accessibility**: Use utilities from `shared/a11y/` for accessibility IDs
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, explicit types, no `any`
- **Clean Architecture**: Component is pure UI, no business logic
- **Conventions**: Arrow function with export default, `type` for props, SCSS variables only

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Link component created with Next.js integration
- [ ] Component uses SCSS variables (no hardcoded values)
- [ ] Component follows project conventions (arrow function, export default, `type` for props)
- [ ] Full accessibility support (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, external link handling)
- [ ] TypeScript types are correct and explicit
- [ ] Component is tested (unit tests in `__tests__/presentation/components/ui/Link.test.tsx`)
- [ ] SCSS variables added if needed
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Component is documented (JSDoc comments)
