# Create Test Utilities

- Type: Task
- Priority: Medium
- Story Points: 2
- Labels: testing, utilities, helpers
- Git Branch: `feat/workbench-14-test-utilities`

## Description

Create shared test utilities and helpers to simplify writing unit and component tests (render helpers, mock factories, data builders).

## User Story

As a developer, I want shared test utilities so that I can write concise, readable tests without duplicating setup logic.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Shared test utility module(s) created
- [ ] Helper for rendering components with common providers (React Query, Zustand, etc.) created
- [ ] Basic data builders or factories for core domain entities created (if needed)

## Technical Considerations

- Domain: utilities to create domain entities for tests
- Usecases: helpers to set up mocked repositories and usecases
- Infrastructure: provide mock implementations via utilities where appropriate
- Presentation: rendering helpers for UI component tests

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Test utilities created under `__tests__/utils/` (or similar)
- [ ] Existing or sample tests refactored to use utilities
- [ ] Utilities documented for other developers

## Related Components

- Files: `__tests__/utils/*`
- Dependencies: Jest, React Testing Library (already installed)
